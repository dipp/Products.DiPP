Overview

    Connect Plone to the fedora repository

Requirements

    Tested with Zope 2.7 and Plone 2.5
    
Installation

	Note: Before installing DiPP product version 2.4, the fedora tool has to be
    deleted from the ZMI. After reinstalling  the configuration
	for fedora has to be manually adjusted, i.e. pid and label must be specified
	on the fedora tool itself, not in the root properties. Otherwise new articles 
	can not be uploaded.
